The object's key of a property\n\t * serves as the name of the task defined by that property, i.e. can be used\n\t * when specifying requirements for other tasks.\n\t * * The `callback` parameter is a `callback(err, result)` which must be called\n\t *   when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of\n\t *   the function's execution. The remaining parameters name other tasks on\n\t *   which the task is dependent, and the results from those tasks are the\n\t *   arguments of those parameters.\n\t * @param {Function} [callback] - An optional callback which is called when all\n\t * the tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks`\n\t * pass an error to their callback, and a `results` object with any completed\n\t * task results, similar to `auto`.\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t * //  The example from `auto` can be rewritten as follows:\n\t * async.autoInject({\n\t *     get_data: function(callback) {\n\t *         // async code to get some data\n\t *         callback(null, 'data', 'converted to array');\n\t *     },\n\t *     make_folder: function(callback) {\n\t *         // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n\t *         // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n\t *         callback(null, 'folder');\n\t *     },\n\t *     write_file: function(get_data, make_folder, callback) {\n\t *         // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n\t *         // write the data to a file in the directory\n\t *         callback(null, 'filename');\n\t *     },\n\t *     email_link: function(write_file, callback) {\n\t *         // once the file is written let's email a link to it...\n\t *         // write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n\t *         callback(null, {'file':write_file, 'email':'user@example.com'});\n\t *     }\n\t * }, function(err, results) {\n\t *     console.log('err = ', err);\n\t *     console.log('email_link = ', results.email_link);\n\t * });\n\t *\n\t * // If you are using a JS minifier that mangles parameter names, `autoInject`\n\t * // will not work with plain functions, since the parameter names will be\n\t * // collapsed to a single letter identifier.  To work around this, you can\n\t * // explicitly specify the names of the parameters your task function needs\n\t * // in an array, similar to Angular.js dependency injection.\n\t *\n\t * // This still has an advantage over plain `auto`, since the results a task\n\t * // depends on are still spread into arguments.\n\t * async.autoInject({\n\t *     //...\n\t *     write_file: ['get_data', 'make_folder', function(get_data, make_folder, callback) {\n\t *         callback(null, 'filename');\n\t *     }],\n\t *     email_link: ['write_file', function(write_file, callback) {\n\t *         callback(null, {'file':write_file, 'email':'user@example.com'});\n\t *     }]\n\t *     //...\n\t * }, function(err, results) {\n\t *     console.log('err = ', err);\n\t *     console.log('email_link = ', results.email_link);\n\t * });\n\t */\n\tfunction autoInject(tasks, callback) {\n\t    var newTasks = {};\n\t\n\t    baseForOwn(tasks, function (taskFn, key) {\n\t        var params;\n\t        var fnIsAsync = isAsync(taskFn);\n\t        var hasNoDeps = !fnIsAsync && taskFn.length === 1 || fnIsAsync && taskFn.length === 0;\n\t\n\t        if (isArray(taskFn)) {\n\t            params = taskFn.slice(0, -1);\n\t            taskFn = taskFn[taskFn.length - 1];\n\t\n\t            newTasks[key] = params.concat(params.length > 0 ? newTask : taskFn);\n\t        } else if (hasNoDeps) {\n\t            // no dependencies, use the function as-is\n\t            newTasks[key] = taskFn;\n\t        } else {\n\t            params = parseParams(taskFn);\n\t            if (taskFn.length === 0 && !fnIsAsync && params.length === 0) {\n\t                throw new Error(\"autoInject task functions require explicit parameters.\");\n\t            }\n\t\n\t            // remove callback param\n\t            if (!fnIsAsync) params.pop();\n\t\n\t            newTasks[key] = params.concat(newTask);\n\t        }\n\t\n\t        function newTask(results, taskCb) {\n\t            var newArgs = arrayMap(params, function (name) {\n\t                return results[name];\n\t            });\n\t            newArgs.push(taskCb);\n\t            wrapAsync$1(taskFn).apply(null, newArgs);\n\t        }\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    auto(newTasks, callback);\n\t}\n\t\n\tvar hasSetImmediate = typeof setImmediate === 'function' && setImmediate;\n\tvar hasNextTick = typeof process === 'object' && typeof process.nextTick === 'function';\n\t\n\tfunction fallback(fn) {\n\t    setTimeout(fn, 0);\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction wrap(defer) {\n\t    return rest(function (fn, args) {\n\t        defer(function () {\n\t            fn.apply(null, args);\n\t        });\n\t    });\n\t}\n\t\n\tvar _defer;\n\t\n\tif (hasSetImmediate) {\n\t    _defer = setImmediate;\n\t} else if (hasNextTick) {\n\t    _defer = process.nextTick;\n\t} else {\n\t    _defer = fallback;\n\t}\n\t\n\tvar setImmediate$1 = wrap(_defer);\n\t\n\t// Simple doubly linked list (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) implementation\n\t// used for queues.

The callback should be called with a\n\t * Error as its first argument to signal that an error occurred.\n\t * Otherwise, if no error occurred, it should be called with `null` as the first\n\t * argument, and any additional `result` arguments that may apply, to signal\n\t * successful completion.\n\t * The callback must be called exactly once, ideally on a later tick of the\n\t * JavaScript event loop.\n\t *\n\t * This type of function is also referred to as a \"Node-style async function\",\n\t * or a \"continuation passing-style function\" (CPS). Most of the methods of this\n\t * library are themselves CPS/Node-style async functions, or functions that\n\t * return CPS/Node-style async functions.\n\t *\n\t * Wherever we accept a Node-style async function, we also directly accept an\n\t * [ES2017 `async` function]{@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function}.\n\t * In this case, the `async` function will not be passed a final callback\n\t * argument, and any thrown error will be used as the `err` argument of the\n\t * implicit callback, and the return value will be used as the `result` value.\n\t * (i.e. a `rejected` of the returned Promise becomes the `err` callback\n\t * argument, and a `resolved` value becomes the `result`.)\n\t *\n\t * Note, due to JavaScript limitations, we can only detect native `async`\n\t * functions and not transpilied implementations.\n\t * Your environment must have `async`/`await` support for this to work.\n\t * (e.g. Node > v7.6, or a recent version of a modern browser).\n\t * If you are using `async` functions through a transpiler (e.g. Babel), you\n\t * must still wrap the function with [asyncify]{@link module:Utils.asyncify},\n\t * because the `async function` will be compiled to an ordinary function that\n\t * returns a promise.\n\t *\n\t * @typedef {Function} AsyncFunction\n\t * @static\n\t */\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\n\t * for working with asynchronous JavaScript.
